            I began my academic journey in my hometown primary and secondary school, excelling in subjects that challenged my mind like math and sciences and sparked my curiosity. Throughout primary and secondary school, I developed a strong foundation in core subjects
            and discovered my love for problem solving and innovation .

            Currently, I am studying at <span class="highlight">Kirinyaga University</span>, where I am expanding my knowledge, developing new skills, and preparing for a future in technology and innovation. University has given me opportunities to explore
