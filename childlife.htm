        <p class="hero-text">
            I was born and raised in a supportive family environment. My childhood was filled with curiosity, learning, and the excitement of discovering new things every day.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-text">
            I remember spending time exploring nature, reading books, and tinkering with small gadgets. These experiences laid the foundation for my passion for technology and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-text">
            I loved playing with my friends, engaging in outdoor activities, and participating in school events, which helped me gain social skills and build lasting friendships.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-text">
            Although I did not have access to tech gadgets as a child, I was always eager to learn and explore. My interest in the technology world grew bigger as I got older. The challenge was the lack of resources and guidance, but when I reached university, I
            got a chance to learn and explore the world of technology and innovation.
